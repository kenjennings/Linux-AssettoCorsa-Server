# Linux-AssettoCorsa-Server
Lame tools for managing the server.

ac - stupid script for launching the server, so I don't have to remember nohup blah de blah.

acpick - WORK IN PROGRESS: A script to examine the content directories on the server an enumerate all the tracks and cars available.   Eventually this will allow the user to choose a track and car and quickly rewrite the server config file.

acpick.txt -  example output from the script enumerating the tracks and track variations, and the availabe cars.
